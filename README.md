Online Payment Fraud Detection System
This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using a machine learning approach. The model is trained on a dataset of online payment transactions, and a Decision Tree classifier is used for classification. The system also handles class imbalance through the use of sample weights.

Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately identify fraudulent online payment transactions. The model is trained using the Decision Tree algorithm, which is then integrated into a Tkinter GUI application for real-time fraud detection prediction.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.
